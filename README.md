# ProjectDeth

First year school game project made in a team of 3. This was my first ever game project in Unity. We made a 2D platformer with traps that aren't
obvious. The project was done in C# and was inspired by the game I Wanna Be the Boshy.

I was responible for making the first level for the game, including traps and scripts to them. 

Most of the assets we used were from the Unity asset store. We used Unity collab to version control 
but I recently decided to add the project to my github too.
